Tips, Tricks, and Instrument-specific Information
=================================================

Choosing appropriate exposure time
----------------------------------

For correcting only focus, 10 seconds is usually sufficient. However, higher order corrections (e.g. coma or any M1 corrections)
requires 30 or more seconds to sufficiently average out atmospheric effects.
